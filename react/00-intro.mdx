# React

## Key Concepts in React

- The UI (aka view) is composed entirely of components
- Components themselves are just JavaScript functions
- Component data drives changes in the rendered UI
- Since the app is data-driven, data should be managed in only a few places

```notes
React is different from jQuery because the source of truth is your components and your application state.
Compare with jQuery, where the source of truth is the DOM itself, and you access it directly.
In React, we work with the DOM indirectly.

## React and the DOM

- In React, you avoid directly manipulating the DOM
- Internally, React keeps track of a "copy" called the Virtual DOM
- React knows to wait for your components to change, then re-render where appropriate
- Allows for greater speed
