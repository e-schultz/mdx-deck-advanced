# JavaScript - const

- follows the same block scope rules as `let`
- can not be re-assigned after it has a value
- do not confuse this with immutability*

* Should this concept be introdued at this time?
* Worth mentioning that `const` should be preferred over `let`, and usage of `let` should always be deliberate rather than wait-and-see?
* In a previous workshop people were tripped up by the notion of using `const` in functions and thought maybe it could only run once with one value. Is this worth addressing?
