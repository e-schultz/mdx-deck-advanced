# TypeScript - Interfaces

---

# The Basics

- Don't Compile to Anything in JavaScript
- Can Be Used to Define the Shape of an Object
- Can Be Used to Inform What a Class Needs to Implement
- Can Define Optional Properties
- Can Define ReadOnly Properties
- Interfaces Can Extend Other Interfaces
- Interfaces Can Extend Other Classes

## Interfaces can also define Readonly

### making const, const

  title="Readonly"
  showNumbers
  steps={[
    {},
    { range: [1, 3], notes: "Declare the Interface" },
    { lines: [2], notes: "Set a property as readonly" },
    { lines: [9], notes: "Will result in a compile time error" }
  ]}
/>

## Type Alias

- Can Use Them as a Way to Create Derived Type
- For Example - a Type That Has a Subset of Keys, Joins Types, or Sets All Properties As Readonly
