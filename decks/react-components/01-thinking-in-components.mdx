# Atomic Design

> We're not designing pages, we're designing systems of components -- Stephen Hay

[Brad Frost - Atomic Design](http://bradfrost.com/blog/post/atomic-web-design/)

---

## Atomic Design Principles

* Don't think about interfaces as Pages
* Instead - stateless, dynamic abstractions,
* Which are rendered based on the state provided

# Atoms

---

export default Split

# Atoms

- The simplest building block
- HTML tags
- Not very useful on their own
- Easily styled
- Very reusable
- Foundation of building a brand

---
export default Split

# Atoms

```html
<Form>
  <Label>Search</Label>
  <Input />
</Form>
```
---
export default ImageSplit

## Molecules

<Image src="./images/molecule.jpg" size="75vh"/>

---
export default Split

## Molecules

- Groups of Atoms bonded together
- Serve as backbone of design system
- For example, a Search Form
- Do one thing, do it well

---
export default ImageSplit

## Molecules

```jsx
<Form onSubmit={ onSubmit }>
  <Label>Search</Label>
  <Input type="text" value={ search } />

  <Button type="submit">Search</Button>
</Form>
```
---

# Organisms

<img src="./images/organism2.jpg" height="90vh"/>

- Groups of molecules
- Distinct section of an interface
- Portable, easily modified

---

# Organisms

```jsx
<Header>
  <Navigator>
    <Brand />
    <NavItem to="home">Home</NavItem>
    <NavItem to="about">About</NavItem>
    <NavItem to="blog">Blog</NavItem>
  </Navigator>
  <SearchForm />
</Header>
```

# Pages

- What the client will see
- Connected containers
- Many components that make up a view

---
export default SplitRight

- Break the UI into a hierarchy
- Single Responsibility Principle
- Think in terms of Information Architecture
- Atoms first, Molecules second

# The Proccess

## Start with a Mock

---

<Image src="./images/thinking-in-react-components.png" size="contain"/>

---

## Component Hierarchy

- **FilterableProductTable**: contains the entirety of the example
- **SearchBar**: receives all user input
- **ProductTable**: displays and filters the data collection based on user input
- **ProductCategoryRow**: displays a heading for each category
- **ProductRow**: displays a row for each product

---
## Exercise: Thinking in Components

Look at the following mock up and try to identify UI components.
