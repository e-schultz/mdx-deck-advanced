# JavaScript - Variable Declarations

- var 
- let 
- const 

---

## Variable Declarations - var 

- Declares a variable 
- Gets hoisted to the top of the scope
- Can be declared more than once

```notes
* Generally speaking we will want to use `let` or `const` instead of var
* Still worth talking a bit about var here - and how it is scoped 
* This will give us a better understanding to why we prefer let and const
```

export default Code 

```javascript Variable Declaration
(function() {
'use strict'
  function example1() {
    var firstName = "Evan";
    console.log("Name", firstName, lastName);
    var lastName = "Schultz";
    console.log("Name", firstName, lastName);
  }

  example1();
})();
```
---

### Hoisting and the Temporal Dead Zone

- Declarations are hoisted 
- Assignments are not 

---
export default Code 

```javascript The Previous Example Is Equivalent To
(function() {
  'use strict';
  function example1() {
    var firstName;
    firstName = "Evan";
    var lastName; // declaration

    console.log("lastName", lastName);
    lastName = "Schultz"; // assignment
    console.log(lastName);
  }

  example1();
})();

```

### Why is hoisting useful?

- Useful for Function Declarations
- Can use them before they are defined in your code
- [Read More About Hoisting](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Hoisting)

```notes
If hoisting can introduce weird problems, when can it be useful?

When declaring functions - it can allow them to be used/called before they are
declared in the code. 

However, be mindful of function declaration vs function assignment
```

export default Code 

```javascript Function Declaration
(function() {
  "use strict";
  doFirstThing();
  doSecondThing();
  doThirdThing();

  function doFirstThing() {
    console.log("I am the first thing");
  }

  function doSecondThing() {
    console.log("I am the second thing");
  }

  function doThirdThing() {
    console.log("I am the third thing");
  }
})();
```

---

### Function Declaration vs Function Assignment

---
export default Code

```javascript Will This Work?
(function() {
  "use strict";
  doFirstThing();

  function doFirstThing() {
    console.log("I am the first thing");
    doSecondThing();
  }

  var doSecondThing = function() {
    console.log("I am the second thing");
  };

  function doThirdThing() {
    console.log("I am the third thing");
  }
})();

```

---

export default Code

```javascript Why Does This Work?
(function() {
  "use strict";
  function doFirstThing() {
    console.log("I am the first thing");
    doSecondThing();
  }

  var doSecondThing = function() {
    console.log("I am the second thing");
  };

  function doThirdThing() {
    console.log("I am the third thing");
  }

  doFirstThing();
})();

```
