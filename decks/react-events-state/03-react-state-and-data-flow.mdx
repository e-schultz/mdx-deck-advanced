# React State & Data Flow

---

## What is State?

* State is Data that changes over time

---

## React State

* React Components can have their own internal state
* Components should not directly mutate their state
* Children can not modify parent state

---

## State / Data Flow

## Brief Intro to React Class Based Components 
### This will be covered more in depth later today.

---

# React.Component 101 

Class that extends from React.Component, which has:

*  `state` property
*  `render` method 
*  `this.setState` method to modify state

---
## Reading and Writing State

* The value of a component's state is modified using the `setState` method
* `setState` is only available on stateful components
* Component state can be accessed from the `state` object (`this.state`)

---

## Setting State 

`setState` can be called in two ways:

* By providing an object 

```jsx
this.setState({
  items: [1,2,3]
})
```

---

## Setting State 

`setState` can be called in two ways:

* By providing a updater method 

```jsx
this.setState((state)=>({
 items: state.items.map(n=>n*2)
}))
```

---

## When to use the updater?

* If the your next state depends on the current state
* React will provide the current state at the time it is being applied
* When not using the updated, `this.state` will refer to the state at the time setState was callled
* [React setState documentation for deeper dive](https://reactjs.org/docs/react-component.html#setstate)

---

## Unidirectional Data Flow

* Data is passed down with props
* Callbacks are passed down and invoked to notify of changes
* Or Events are emitted

---

### Example - Removing Item from List

<Box style={{width: "80vw"}}>
  <CodeSandbox src={`https://codesandbox.io/embed/github/e-schultz/ts-js-react-training/tree/${BRANCH_NAME}/examples/react-list-example-remove-item?autoresize=1&codemirror=1&fontsize=14&module=%2Fsrc%2FApp.js`}/>
</Box>

---

### Why should the Parent handle the change?

* The child notifies that we want to be done.
* The parent controls how it is done.
* The parent provided the data - so it controls how it is updated

---
### Example - Use confirm to control if the item is removed

<Box style={{width: "80vw"}}>
  <CodeSandbox src={`https://codesandbox.io/embed/github/e-schultz/ts-js-react-training/tree/${BRANCH_NAME}/examples/react-list-example-remove-item?autoresize=1&codemirror=1&fontsize=14&module=%2Fsrc%2FApp.js`}/>
</Box>

---

### Exercise - Add "Remove" functionality to the Robot List 

* Modify the Robot Card / List
* Add a Remove Button to the Robot Card
* Add a callback prop 
* Modify the parent to remove the Robot once the button is clicked

---

### Exercise - Robot List Remove - Start

</Box>

### Exercise - Robot List Remove - Solution 

<Box style={{width: "80vw"}}>
  <CodeSandbox src={`https://codesandbox.io/embed/github/e-schultz/ts-js-react-training/tree/${BRANCH_NAME}/exercises//events-robot-list-remove-robot-end?autoresize=1&codemirror=1&fontsize=14&module=%2Fsrc%2FApp.js`}/>
</Box>

---

## setState is Asynchronous

* Changes to state will not be available right away
* setState's second argument is a callback that can be used to avoid issues with this

---

## Without Callback

```jsx
handleCountChange(value) {
  this.setState({ helloWorldCount: value })
  // This will log the old value
  console.log(this.state.helloWorldCount)
}
```

---


## With Callback

```jsx
handleCountChange(value) {
  this.setState(
    { helloWorldCount: value },
    // This will log the new value
    () => { console.log(this.state.helloWorldCount) }
  )
}
```
