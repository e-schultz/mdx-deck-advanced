# Handling Events

---

## Events in React 

- React provides APIs for dealing with many common events, called SyntheticEvents
- Often similar to browser events, but camelCase
- These events are cross-browser compatible

---

## Common React Events

- `onClick`
- `onKeyUp`
- `onChange`
- `onInput`
- `onSubmit`

... [and more](https://reactjs.org/docs/events.html)

---

## Event Handlers

- Using JSX, you can attach handler functions to events
- Event handlers will implicitly receive the event object as a parameter

---

```javascript
const handleClick(event) {
  event.preventDefault()
  console.log('I was clicked!')
}
return <button type="button" onClick={handleClick}>Click Me</button>
```

---

```javascript Getting Values
const handleInput(event) {
  console.log(`The user typed ${event.target.value}`)
}
return <input type="text" onInput={handleInput}>Click Me</button>
```

---

## Passing other arguments to event handlers

- Use an arrow function that receives the event explicitly and returns your callback
- Add any additional parameters you need here
- You can pass the event through, or ignore it if you don't need it

---

```javascript 
  const deleteRow = (rowId, event) => {
    console.log(`Delete ${rowId}`)
  }
  return rows.map((row, rowId) => {
    ...
    <button onClick={(event) => deleteRow(rowId, event)}>Delete Row</button>
  })
```
