# Object Spread/Rest 

---

- ES2015 introduced the `...rest/...spread` operator
- Can allow us to construct new objects while omitting properties
- Can allow us to create new objects and merge in new properties
- Can create shallow copies of objects 

---

## Object Rest

- This will assign `2018` to the variable `year`
- Creates a new object with properties: `make`, `model`
    
```js
let car = { make: 'Toyota', model: 'Camery', year: '2018'};
const { year, ...carWithoutYear} = car;
console.log(year);
console.log(carWithoutYear)
```

```notes
This is useful when are passing a number of properties into a function,
and want to 'pluck off' a few to be used - and pass the rest down
to another function. 
```

---
## Object Spread 

```js
function createCar(make,model, year) {
    return { make, model, year}
}
function updateYear(car,year) { 
    return { ...car, year}
}
let car = createCar('Toyota','Camery','2018')
let newCar = updateYear(car,'2019');
console.log('car', car);
console.log('newCar', newCar)
```

```notes
Notice how we have not modified the initial car object,
by usinfg the `...spread` operator - we have created a
shallow copy of the object.
```

---

## Accidental Mutation

```js
function createCar(make,model, year) {
    return { make, model, year}
}
function updateYear(car,year) { 
    car.year = year;
    return car;
}
let car = createCar('Toyota','Camery','2018')
let newCar = updateYear(car,'2019');
console.log('car', car);
console.log('newCar', newCar)
```

```notes
Notice how in this case - both car, and newCar 
have the updated year.
* note: might have a few code pens setup 
or goto live-coding to talk about mutation of objects,
shallow vs deep clone, etc
```
