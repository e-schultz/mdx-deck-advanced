# React Performance

---

## Render Default Behaviour 

* A component will re-render every time
* This does not update the DOM  
* This updates / generates the Virtual DOM
* React will then diff the VDOM to the DOM 

---

## Under the Hood 

React uses an O(n) algorithm based on two assumptions

* Two elements of different types will produce different trees.
* Developers can hint which child elements may be stable across different renders with a key prop.

---

## React Diffing Basics 

* If the root element type changes - react will tear down and rebuild the tree

```jsx
<div>
  <Child/>
</div>

<span>
  <Child/>
</span>
```

---

## Diff of Same Element Type

* React will see that only `className` has changed
* It will modify that - instead of recreating the DOM

```jsx
<div className="before" title="stuff" />

<div className="after" title="stuff" />
```

---

## Controlling Updates - shouldComponentUpdate

* Can implement `shouldComponentUpdate`
* If it returns true - render will run on it, and it's children
* If it returns false - will not render, or render it's children

---

## Controlling Updates - Immutability

* If using Immutable patterns, can use `shouldComponentUpdate` for some quick gains
* Can check if the reference of the object / state has changed, and not do a shallow compare


```jsx
// ...
shouldComponentUpdate(prevProp) {
  return this,props.complexProp !== prevProp.complexProp
}

```
