# Subclassing 

<Appear>
    <h1> Avoid It </h1>
    <h2> But, if we must ..... </h2>
</Appear>

## Mental Model 

- I do not use Classes often in my code 
- Usually for framework specific needs
- Prefer to have Objects that contain data
- Prefer to have functions that operate on data 
- Seperate behaviour from Data

```notes
eventual todo: C# class vs ES6/TypeScript class?
```

## But If We Must ....

* Fat Arrow for Class Methods keeps the context of `this`
* But what happens if we are not consistent with this?


---
export default FullScreenCode

## Look at `sayHello () =>`

<ReplIt src="https://repl.it/@e_schultz/Classes-SubClass-starting-point-sayHello?lite=true"/>

```notes
* Both methods are using fat arrow for say hello
* What happens if we use normal methods?
```

export default FullScreenCode

## What if one isn't fat?

<ReplIt src="https://repl.it/@e_schultz/Classes-SubClass-inconsistent-this-binding?lite=true"/>

export default FullScreenCode

## What if we make them normal methods?
