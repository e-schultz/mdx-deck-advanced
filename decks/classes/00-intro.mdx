# ES6 Classes

```notes
We will cover classes a bit more once we gcdet into TypeScript,
for now we will look at the ES6 constructs
```
---
## Class Declarations

```js
class Person {
    firstName;
    lastName;
    constructor(firstName, lastName) {
        this.firstName = firstName;
        this.lastName = lastName;
    }
}
```
---
## Hoisting 

Class declarations do not get hoisted.

```js
let evan = new Person('Evan','Schultz');

class Person {
    firstName;
    lastName;
    constructor(firstName, lastName) {
        this.firstName = firstName;
        this.lastName = lastName;
    }
}
```

### ES6 Classes - will this always work as we expected?

## Whats going on?

- `greet` is added to the prototype 
- `this` is bound to the context of which it is called 
- When passing it as a callback, that context gets lost
- `sayHello` is getting declared and assigned wen a new instance is created
- it is not on the prototype
- `this` will point to the instance of the person

### Person Prototype

* `greet` is on the prototype
* `sayHello` is not 

---

## How can we fix this?

- Prefer `fatArrow () =>`
- Bind `this` in the constructor 

---

### Prefer `fatArrow () =>`

```javascript
class Person {
    firstName;
    lastName;
    constructor(firstName, lastName) {
        this.firstName = firstName;
        this.lastName = lastName;
    }
    greet = (greeting) => {
        console.log(`${this.firstName} ${this.lastName}`)
    }
```    
---
### Bind this in the constructor

```javascript
class Person {
    firstName;
    lastName;
    constructor(firstName, lastName) {
        this.firstName = firstName;
        this.lastName = lastName;
        this.greet = this.greet.bind(this);
    }
    greet(greeting) {
        console.log(`${this.firstName} ${this.lastName}`)
    }
``` 
---

### Trade Offs?

- When using `()=>` - a new function is created for every new instance of `Person`
- Generally this is not a problem, and has minimal performance impact
- Ensuring that you bind all of the methods in the constructor is easy to forget
- The bugs that can crop up due to `this` not being what you expect can be more costly
- When binding in the constructor - you are creating a new copy of greet
