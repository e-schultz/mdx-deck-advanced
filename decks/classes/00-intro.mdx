# ES6 Classes


```notes
We will cover classes a bit more once we gcdet into TypeScript,
for now we will look at the ES6 constructs
```
---
## Class Declarations

```js
class Person {
    firstName;
    lastName;
    constructor(firstName, lastName) {
        this.firstName = firstName;
        this.lastName = lastName;
    }
}
```
## Hoisting 

Class declarations do not get hoisted.

```js
let evan = new Person('Evan','Schultz');

class Person {
    firstName;
    lastName;
    constructor(firstName, lastName) {
        this.firstName = firstName;
        this.lastName = lastName;
    }
}
```
## Class Methods
