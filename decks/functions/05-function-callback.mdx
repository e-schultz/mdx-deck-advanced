# Function Callback

- Functions can be assigned to variables
- Functions that are assigned to variables can be invoked like you would expect

---
export default FullScreenCode

## Function Assignment 

```javascript
// here is a normal function declaration
function myRegularFunction(a, b) {
  return a + b;
}

// here we are creating a new variable, and assigning myRegular
const copiedRegFunction = myRegularFunction;

// assigns the RESULT (return statement) of an invoked function
const resultOf3Plus4 = myRegularFunction(3, 4);

// invokes the myRegularFunction
copiedRegFunction(5, 10);
```

---

## Function Callback

- If we can assign a function to a variable, this means we can assign a function as an argument
- Parameters that are functions are often referred to as callbacks

---
export default Code 

```javascript Function Callbacks
// accept a number, and a ballback
function basicCallback(number, callback) {
  // I am passing the number into the callback, and assigning the result
  const result = callback(number);
  // and here I return the result
  return result;
}

// a little function that doubles a number and returns the result
const double = (number) => number * 2;
const tripple = (number) => number * 3;

const doubled = basicCallback(5, double);
const trippled = basicCallback(6, tripple);
console.log({doubled, trippled})
```

# Pure Functions

- Minimalistic and explicit 
- No side effects! 
- Should have a return statement

---

### Minimalistic 

- Should be small and clear
- Do one thing, and one thing well
- Composable into larger operations

---

### Avoid Side Effects

- Don't access or change something that exists outside the function; 
- Only use values passed into the function 
- Avoid mutation of objects passed into the function 

---

### Should have a return statement

- think of a pure function like a small factory. 
- you give it the supplies and it outputs the product. 
- Calling with the same inputs, should result in the same result.

```javascript
  const add = (a,b)=>a+b;
  add(1,2); // should return 3 every time.
```
