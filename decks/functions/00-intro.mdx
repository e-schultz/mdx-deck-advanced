# Functions

# Parameters

- 0 or many items that are passed into a function for its use
- A function defines the parameters it expects
- The order of the parameters passed in should match the order expected by the function

---

```javascript
function addNumbers(number1, number2) {
  return number1 + number2;
}

// number1 recieves the value of 5
// number2 recieves the value of 7
const total = addNumbers(5, 7);
```

---

# Parameters

- In ES6, you can assign default parameter values to be used when an argument is not passed in
- You can also use the rest operator to group the parameters together as an array
- It's important to name your parameters well to help with readability

---

```javascript
// we can see that number2 has an assignment, = 8
// this assignment is only applied if a second argument isn't passed in
function addNumbers(number1, number2 = 8) {
  return number1 + number2;
}

// number1 gets the value of 5
// Without a second argument, number2 is set to 8
const total = addNumbers(5); // resolves to 13

// we can also use the spread operator (...) in the parameter definition
// this will take all arguments passed in and put them into a single array
function keepTheLastItem(...items) {
  return items[items.length - 1];
}

keepTheLastItem(3, 1, 66, 21, 15); // this returns 15
```


---

# Returns

- A return statement is something you should have in almost all of your functions
- Without a return, a function resolves to 'undefined'
- You can be very creative about what is returned - for example, you can return another function
- The result of a function return can be used immediately after that function has finished its business

---

```javascript
function return10() {
  return 10;
}

function returnTen() {
  10;
}

const result = return10(); // the value is the number 10
const result2 = returnTen(); // the value is undefined
```
