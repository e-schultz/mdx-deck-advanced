# Pure Functions

- Minimalistic and explicit 
- No side effects! 
- Should have a return statement
- Doesn't modify or depend on anything outside of its scope
- Should return the same result given the same input

---

## Avoid Side Effects

- Don't access or change something that exists outside the function; 
- Only use values passed into the function 
- Avoid mutation of objects passed into the function 

---

## Should have a return statement

- Think of a pure function like a small factory
- You give it the supplies and it outputs the product
- Calling with the same inputs should result in the same result
- Should not have any other side effects

export default Code

```javascript Pure Function
function add(a, b) {
  return a + b;
}
console.log('1st call', add(1, 2)); // should return 3 every time.
console.log('2nd call', add(1, 2));
console.log('3rd call', add(1, 2));
```

export default Code

```javascript Impure Function
let count = 0;

function add(input) {
  count+=input;
  return count;
}

console.log(add(1));
console.log(add(1));
console.log(add(1));
console.log(count);
```

## Why use Pure Functions?

- Predictable
- Easily testable
- Composable
- Easy to Refactor
- Avoid unecessary mutation

## Pure Functions in the Real World

- Not every function in your system can be pure (e.g. HTTP calls)
- Using mostly pure functions with some impure functions keeps your code clean
- Use pure functions by default and impure functions deliberately
