# Pure Functions

- Minimalistic and explicit 
- No side effects! 
- Should have a return statement
- Doesn't modify or depend on anything outside of its scope

---

## Avoid Side Effects

- Don't access or change something that exists outside the function; 
- Only use values passed into the function 
- Avoid mutation of objects passed into the function 

---

## Should have a return statement

- Think of a pure function like a small factory.
- You give it the supplies and it outputs the product.
- Calling with the same inputs should result in the same result
- Should not have any other side effects

export default Code

```javascript Pure Function
function add(a, b) {
  return a + b;
}
add(1, 2); // should return 3 every time.
```

```javascript Impure Function
let count = 0;

function increaseCount() {
  ++count
}

increaseCount()
console.log(count)
```

## Why use Pure Functions?

- Predictable
- Easily testable
- Composable
- Easy to Refactor
- Avoid unecessary mutation

## Pure Functions in the Real World

- Not every function in your system can be pure (e.g. HTTP calls)
- Using mostly pure functions with some impure functions keeps your code clean
- Use pure functions by default and impure functions deliberately
