# What `this` Context?	

---
## `this` gets confusing 	

* `this` has been the source of many errors	
* `this` context can change 	
* `this` is not what you are used to in C#	

---

> Context is always the value of the `this` keyword which is a reference to the object that “owns” the currently executing code.	

---

## A simple way of thinking about it ....	

* `owner.method();`	
* The thing that is left of the `.` is the context owner 	
* If it is just `method()` - it is unbound, and the context is global	
* Unless it is a arrow function `() =>` - and `this` is the function it's called in

this is a useful lie ....

# Let's explore this with some examples ...

export default FullScreenCode	

## Example - `this` on an object	

<ReplIt src="https://repl.it/@e_schultz/01-Exploring-Context-of-This?lite=true"/>	


```notes	
* Go through things like 	
- let hello = evan.sayHello;	
- hello();	
* - passing evan.sayHello into a call back 	
* - making a new object and assigning hello to it	
* - exploring bind	
```

## Example - `this` on an class

## Example - Changing the context of `this`	

<ReplIt src="https://repl.it/@e_schultz/03-Exploring-Context-of-This-class-and-binding-context?lite=true"/>	

```notes	
can also walk through something like:	
let bob = {	
  firstName: 'bob',	
  lastName: 'uncle'	
}	
bob.sayHello = evan.sayHello;//.bind(renee)	
bob.sayHello()	
and the output with and without `bind`	
```
