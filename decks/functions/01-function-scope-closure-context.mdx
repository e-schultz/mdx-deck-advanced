# Function - Scope, Closures, and Context 

---

## Context vs Scope

* Similar, but not the same
* Every function execution has both 
* Scope is function based
* Context is object based

---

# Scope 

> In other words, scope pertains to the variable access of a function when it is invoked and is unique to each invocation.

---

### Variable Scope

* Local or Global 
* Local is within a function context
* `var` is hoisted to the top of the function 
* `let` and `const` are scoped within a block
