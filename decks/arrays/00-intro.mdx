# Arrays

---

## What we will cover

* Array Basics
* Iterating Arrays
* Array Spreading/Destructuring

---

## Arrays are

* Collections of any other type, including other arrays
* The main interable in JavaScript
* Always indexed with integers, starting from 0
* Mutated by some methods, but not others
* Truthy even when empty

---

export default Code

```javascript Creating Arrays
const fruits = [];

fruits.push('Apples');
console.log(fruits);

fruits.unshift('Oranges');
console.log(fruits);

fruits[2] = 'Bananas';
console.log(fruits);
```

---

## What happened?

* `push` mutates the array by adding a value to the end
* `unshift` mutates the array by adding a value to the beginning
* Arrays can be directly assigned values at particular instances

export default Code

```javascript Accessing from arrays
const numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];

console.log(
    numbers[0], // First element
    numbers[numbers.length - 1], // Last element
    numbers['1'], // Second element
    numbers.find(number => number > 3), // First element greater than 3
    numbers.filter(number => number % 2 === 0) // All even numbers
);
```

---

## What happened?

* Arrays can be accessed directly by their index using bracket notation
* We can also use array methods to search through arrays for values
* These array methods take a function as an argument

export default Code

```javascript Arrays and mutation
const numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
const numbersTwo = numbers;
const numbersThree = numbers.slice(numbers);

numbers.push(6);

console.log(numbers);
console.log(numbersTwo);
console.log(numbersThree);
```
