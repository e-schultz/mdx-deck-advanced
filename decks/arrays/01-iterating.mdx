## Iterating Arrays

* In ES6, we mainly use array methods to iterate and transform array data
* Many of these methods avoid mutation issues

---

## Mapping

* Steps over each item in the array
* Gives you access to the current item in the array and optionally the index
* Writes whatever you return to that position in the new array

---

export default Code

```javascript Mapping Arrays

const leia = { firstName: 'Carrie', lastName: 'Fisher' };
const luke = { firstName: 'Mark', lastName: 'Hamill' };
const han = { firstName: 'Harrison', lastName: 'Ford' };

const cast = [leia, luke, han];

const castFirstNames = cast.map(castMember => castMember.firstName);
const castWithIds = cast.map((castMember, i) => ({...castMember, id: i }));

console.log(cast);
console.log(castFirstNames);
console.log(castWithIds);
```

---

## Reducing

* Steps over each item in the array
* Gives you access to the current item, the index, and an accumulator
* The accumulator is the final value that will be returned 
* Performs an operation and returns the accumulated value
* The accumulated value can be of any type and length, which makes reduce very flexible

---

export default Code

```javascript Reducing Arrays
const numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4];
const sum = numbers.reduce((accumulator, currentValue) => accumulator + currentValue);
console.log(sum);
```

---

## ForEach

* Steps over each item in the array
* Has no return value, but executes a block of code for each item in the array
* Suitable for performing an operation, but use `map` if you're transforming data

---

export default Code

```javascript ForEach Arrays

function logItem(item) {
    console.log(item);
}

const items = ['Cat', 'Hat', 'Chat', 'Chapeau'];

items.forEach(item => logItem(item));
```
