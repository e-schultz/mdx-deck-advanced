# Destructuring with Rest and Spread

---

- ES2015 introduced the `...rest/...spread` operator
- Can construct new objects/arrays while omitting properties
- Can create new objects/arrays and merge in new properties
- Can create shallow copies of objects

---

## Destructuring Assignment
- Shorthand assign items in an array or properties in an object to variables
- For arrays, assignment is order-based
- For objects, assignment uses the key names

---
export default Code

```javascript Assignment with Objects
const { roofColour } = {
    roofColour: 'red',
    floorColour: 'black',
    doorColour: 'green',
}
console.log(roofColour)
```

export default Code

```javascript Assignment with Arrays
let dateArray =  "2013-11-29".split('-')
let [year, month, day] = dateArray
console.log(year, month, day)
```
