## Rest

* Gathers any remaining elements in an object/array (i.e. the "rest")
* Useful especially when dealing with unknown quantities

---

## Object Rest

* Assign variables to properties in the object
* Create object with remaining properties

---


```javascript Object Rest
  let car = { make: 'Toyota', model: 'Camry', year: '2018'};
  const { year, ...carWithoutYear } = car;
  console.log(year);
  console.log(carWithoutYear)
```

```notes
Apparently `rest property is not supported in the
node run-kit
```
---

This is useful when are passing a number of properties into a function,
and want to 'pluck off' a few to be used - and pass the rest down
to another function.

---

export default Code

```javascript Array Rest
function getBiggest(...args) {
    return args.sort(function(a, b){
        return b-a
    })[0]
}

console.log(getBiggest(10, 5));
console.log(getBiggest(3, 3, 3));
console.log(getBiggest(1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6));
```
