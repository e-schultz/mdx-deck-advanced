## Rest

* Gathers any remaining elements in an object/array (i.e. the "rest")
* Useful especially when dealing with unknown quantities

---

export default Code

```javascript Object Rest
let car = { make: 'Toyota', model: 'Camery', year: '2018'};
const { year, ...carWithoutYear } = car;
console.log(year);
console.log(carWithoutYear)
```

---

This is useful when are passing a number of properties into a function,
and want to 'pluck off' a few to be used - and pass the rest down
to another function.

export default Code

```javascript Array Rest
function getBiggest(...args) {
    return args.sort(function(a, b){
        return b-a
    })[0]
}

console.log(getBiggest(10, 5));
console.log(getBiggest(3, 3, 3));
console.log(getBiggest(1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6));
```
