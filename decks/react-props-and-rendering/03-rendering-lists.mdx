# Rendering Lists

---

## Rendering Lists

- Remember - you can pass any JavaScript value or object as a value to a Prop
- This includes Arrays
- You can use Array methods like `map`, `filter`, `reduce` to transform your data into components.

---

## Rendering Lists

- `map` is used to transform one object to another
- Can transform data into JSX
- Can also reduce a list of items into a Component
- Lists should specify a `key` attribute

---

### Rendering Lists - Keys

- Keys help React identify which items have changed, are added, or are removed.
- Keys should be given to the elements inside the array to give the elements a stable identity.
- If your record has an `id` - that is the most common attribute to use.

## Rendering Lists

```jsx
const people = [{ id: 0, firstName: "Evan", lastName: "Schultz" }];
/* .... */
// inside of a component
 return (
      <div>
        {people.map(person => (
            <Person
              key={person.id}
              firstName={person.firstName}
              lastName={person.lastName} />
          )
        )}
      </div>
    );
```
