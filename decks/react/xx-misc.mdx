## ES6 Component Shorthands

- A "fat arrow" function (which has more sensible treatment of `this`)
- Which is assigned to a name
- Which is a constant rather than a variable

---

## JavaScript in the UI

- You can use any kind of JavaScript in a component
- Any code in JSX between `{ }` braces will be evaluated

---

export default FullScreenCode

# Menu List

<CodeSandbox src="https://codesandbox.io/embed/l7rll6j62m?autoresize=0&eslint=1&fontsize=14&hidenavigation=1&moduleview=1"/>

## Making Components Usable Anywhere

- Use exports and inputs to use components anywhere
- Part of the new-style ES6 module syntax
- Which isn't yet supported by Node for server-side applications

```js
export default HelloWorld
```

---

export default FullScreenCode

```js Use Components Inside Components
import HelloWorld from './HelloWorld'

const App = () => (
<div>
    <h1>My First React App</h1>
    <HelloWorld />
</div>
)

export default App
```

## React Conventions

- Using a default export for components is a React convention
- `HelloWorld.js` will (almost always) export `HelloWorld` and only `HelloWorld`
