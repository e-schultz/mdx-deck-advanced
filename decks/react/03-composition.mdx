import { FullScreenCode } from "mdx-deck/layouts";

## The "Children" Prop

- A special type of prop
- This represents whatever is passed inside of the tags of a React component
- Think of it like a "slot" that something can be placed into later

---

export default FullScreenCode

```
const PageHeader = ({children}) =>
(<header>
    <h1>Welcome!</h1>
    {children}
</header>)

<PageHeader>
    // This list will be displayed in our header, below "Welcome"
    <ul>
        <li>Home</li>
        <li>About</li>
        <li>Contact</li>
    </ul>
</PageHeader>
```

## Why is it important?

- Components stay flexible when we can switch out their contents
- We can make many small components to use where we need them
- Allows for greater component re-use
