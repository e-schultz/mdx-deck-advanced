## The "Children" Prop

- A special type of prop
- This represents whatever is passed inside of the tags of a React component
- Think of it like a "slot" that something can be placed into later

---

import { childrenOne } from './snippets/03-composition'

<LiveCode
	code={childrenOne}
	size="large"
	previewProps={{ style: { fontSize: '0.8em' } }}
	editorProps={{ style: { fontSize: '0.5em', background: '#001628' } }}
/>

## Why is it important?

- Components stay flexible when we can switch out their contents
- We can make many small components to use where we need them
- Allows for greater component re-use
