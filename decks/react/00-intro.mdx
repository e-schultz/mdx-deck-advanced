## Key Concepts

- The UI is composed  of components
- Components are just JavaScript functions or Classes
- Data provided to components Component drive the UI
- Since the app is data-driven, data should be managed in only a few places

```notes
React is different from jQuery because the source of truth is your components and your application state.
Compare with jQuery, where the source of truth is the DOM itself, and you access it directly.
In React, we work with the DOM indirectly.
```

## Key Concepts - Unidirectional Data Flow

- Data is passed down with Props 
- Events or Callbacks are used to notify parent of changes  

---

## React and the DOM

- React handles updating the DOM for you
- It is rare you will need to access the DOM yourself 
- Internally, React keeps track of a "copy" called the Virtual DOM
- React knows to wait for your components to change, then re-render where appropriate
- Allows for greater speed

## React & Component-Based Architecture

### Components Should be

- The lego-like building blocks of your system
- Easily composable and reusable
- Divided by responsibility

```notes
- Pieces of the system requiring the same responsibility should rely on a shared component
```
