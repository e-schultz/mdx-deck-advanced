## Key Concepts in React

- The UI is composed  of components
- Components  just JavaScript functions
- Data provided to components Component drive the UI
- Since the app is data-driven, data should be managed in only a few places

```notes
React is different from jQuery because the source of truth is your components and your application state.
Compare with jQuery, where the source of truth is the DOM itself, and you access it directly.
In React, we work with the DOM indirectly.
```

## React and the DOM

- In React, you avoid directly manipulating the DOM
- Internally, React keeps track of a "copy" called the Virtual DOM
- React knows to wait for your components to change, then re-render where appropriate
- Allows for greater speed

## Component-Based Architecture & React

- The system should be composed of modular pieces (like lego) called components
- Components should be easily composable and reusable
- Components should be divided by responsibility
- Pieces of the system requiring the same responsibility should rely on a shared component
