# React Components

- Reusabble building blocks of the application
- Can take inputs from parent components, called props
- Can be Class Based, or functions 

---

## JSX

- "HTML" in JavaScript
- The standard way to write React components
- Can contain JavaScript which will be evaluated upon compilation
- Will be compiled to template literals and `React.createElement` calls

---

### React JSX Example 

<Box width={'75vw'}>

```javascript JSX Example

// This is identical...
const element = (
  <h1 className="greeting">
    Hello, world!
  </h1>
);

// To this
const sameElement = React.createElement(
  'h1',
  {className: 'greeting'},
  'Hello, world!'
);
```

</Box>
---

## What Happened?

- HelloWorld is the same in all cases - a function that will show text
- JSX-to-JavaScript compilation translates `<div>...</div>` into return value
---
export default Invert 

# Component Types

---

## Generally two types of Compomnents 

* Stateless
* Stateful

---

export default Split 

# Stateless

- Super simple
- Just a function
- Give props
- Return dom

---
export default Split 

# Stateful

- Internal state
- Component Lifecycle Hooks
- Class that extends from React.Component

---

## Why does it matter?

- React triggers page re-renders by "react"ing to data updates
- Only stateful components can trigger rerendering
- When a stateful component re-renders, it will also re-render all its children

---

## How does React know to rerender?
- When a stateful component updates its internal state, the component is marked
- React runs through a pristine/dirty checking process and updates all dirty components
- React does NOT compare your old and new state values

---

## What does that mean?

- Build React apps with mostly stateless components
- Use stateful components higher up in the component tree to manage data flow

---

## Creating a Stateless Component

- Components are functions
- Should return a single root JSX tag
- Can contain multiple children within the root tag
---

## Stateless - Hello World Component & Children
