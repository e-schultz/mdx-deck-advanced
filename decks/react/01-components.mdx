## React Components

- The core building blocks of React applications
- Pieces of UI that represent some chunk of the element tree
- Generate elements during rendering - don't exist in the real DOM
- Can take inputs from parent components, called props

---

## JSX

- "HTML" in JavaScript
- The standard way to write React components
- Can contain JavaScript which will be evaluated upon compilation
- Will be compiled to template literals and `React.createElement` calls

---

export default FullScreenCode

```javascript JSX Example
const element = (
  <h1 className="greeting">
    Hello, world!
  </h1>
);

const sameElement = React.createElement(
  'h1',
  {className: 'greeting'},
  'Hello, world!'
);
```

---

export default FullScreenCode

```javascript JSX Will Be Interpreted
function tick() {
  const element = (
    <div>
      <h1>Hello, world!</h1>
      <h2>It is {new Date().toLocaleTimeString()}.</h2>
    </div>
  );
  ReactDOM.render(element, document.getElementById('root'));
}

setInterval(tick, 1000);
```

## Creating a Component

- Components are functions
- To be rendered, they should return a single JSX tag
- Any number of children can be contained in the root tag

---

export default FullScreenCode

```js
import React from 'react';

function HelloWorld() {
  return (<header>
    <h1>
        Hello World!
    </h1>
  </header>);
}
```
---

## ES6 Component Shorthands

- A "fat arrow" function (which has more sensible treatment of `this`)
- Which is assigned to a name
- Which is a constant rather than a variable

---

export default FullScreenCode

```js
const HelloWorld = () => {
  return <div>Hello world!</div>;
}

// You can also use implicit returns
const HelloWorld = () => <div>Hello world!</div>;
```

---

## What Happened?

- HelloWorld is the same in all cases - a function that will show text
- JSX-to-JavaScript compilation translates `<div>...</div>` into return value

---

## JavaScript in the UI

- You can use any kind of JavaScript in a component
- Any code in JSX between `{ }` braces will be evaluated

---

export default FullScreenCode

```js
const MenuList = () => {
    const locations = ['Home', 'About', 'Contact'];

    return (<ul>
        { locations.map((item, i) => <li key={i}>{item.name}</li>) }
    </ul>)
}
```

---

## Making Components Usable Anywhere

- Add an `export default` statement at the bottom to make `HelloWorld` visible to other modules
- Part of the new-style ES6 module syntax
- Which isn't yet supported by Node for server-side applications

```js
export default HelloWorld
```

---

export default FullScreenCode

```js Use Components Inside Components
import HelloWorld from './HelloWorld'

const App = () => (
<div>
    <h1>My First React App</h1>
    <HelloWorld />
</div>
)

export default App
```

---

## React Conventions

- Using a default export for components is a React convention
- `HelloWorld.js` will (almost always) export `HelloWorld` and only `HelloWorld`
