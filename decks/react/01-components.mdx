## React Components

- The core building blocks of React applications
- Pieces of UI that represent some chunk of the element tree
- Generate elements during rendering - don't exist in the real DOM
- Can take inputs from parent components, called props

---

## JSX

- "HTML" in JavaScript
- The standard way to write React components
- Can contain JavaScript which will be evaluated upon compilation
- Will be compiled to template literals and `React.createElement` calls

---

export default FullScreenCode

```javascript JSX Example

// This is identical...
const element = (
  <h1 className="greeting">
    Hello, world!
  </h1>
);

// To this
const sameElement = React.createElement(
  'h1',
  {className: 'greeting'},
  'Hello, world!'
);
```

---

## What Happened?

- HelloWorld is the same in all cases - a function that will show text
- JSX-to-JavaScript compilation translates `<div>...</div>` into return value

---
export default FullScreenCode

# Hello World Component

<CodeSandbox src="https://codesandbox.io/embed/1080oxnw33?eslint=1&fontsize=14&hidenavigation=1&module=%2Fsrc%2Fhello-world.js&moduleview=1"/>

---

## Creating a Component

- Components are functions
- To be rendered, they should return a single JSX tag
- Any number of children can be contained in the root tag

---
export default FullScreenCode

# Hello World - Children

<CodeSandbox src="https://codesandbox.io/embed/8l3wmjzk82?eslint=1&fontsize=14&hidenavigation=1&module=%2Fsrc%2Fhello-world.js"/>
---

## ES6 Component Shorthands

- A "fat arrow" function (which has more sensible treatment of `this`)
- Which is assigned to a name
- Which is a constant rather than a variable

---

## JavaScript in the UI

- You can use any kind of JavaScript in a component
- Any code in JSX between `{ }` braces will be evaluated

---
export default FullScreenCode

# Menu List

<CodeSandbox src="https://codesandbox.io/embed/jzxzvml555?autoresize=0&eslint=1&fontsize=14&hidenavigation=1&moduleview=1"/>

---

## Making Components Usable Anywhere

- Use exports and inputs to use components anywhere
- Part of the new-style ES6 module syntax
- Which isn't yet supported by Node for server-side applications

```js
export default HelloWorld
```

---

export default FullScreenCode

```js Use Components Inside Components
import HelloWorld from './HelloWorld'

const App = () => (
<div>
    <h1>My First React App</h1>
    <HelloWorld />
</div>
)

export default App
```

---

## React Conventions

- Using a default export for components is a React convention
- `HelloWorld.js` will (almost always) export `HelloWorld` and only `HelloWorld`
