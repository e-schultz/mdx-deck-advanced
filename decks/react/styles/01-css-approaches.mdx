## CSS approaches

* CSS is all in the global scope by default
* CSS-in-JS approaches with React let you scope your CSS to individual components
* Functional CSS approaches let you avoid writing redundant CSS

---

## CSS-in-JS

* Approaches that move some part of the CSS process into JavaScript
* Normally try to solve the problem of CSS being in the global scope
* Can require more set up, but end up more flexible in the long term
* Read into CSS Modules and Styled Components if this method is of interest

---

## Functional CSS

* AKA Atomic CSS
* Many small, single-purpose classes
* Write less CSS and stay more consistent by using what already exists
* Libraries like Tachyons, Tailwind and Bulma

---

## Tachyons

```css
.flex {
    display: flex;
}
.flex-row {
    flex-direction: flex-row;
}
.pl4 {
    padding-left: 4rem;
}
.f3 {
    font-size: 3rem;
}
```

---

### Traditional Approach

```javascript
const Menu = ({ items }) => (
    <ul className="menu">
        {items.map((item, i) => (
            <li className="menu-item" key={i}>{item.name}</li>
        ))
    </ul>
)

```

```notes
All the styles would be written under the menu class
```

---

### With Tachyons

```javascript
const Menu = ({ items }) => (
    <ul className="flex flex-row f3">
        {items.map((item, i) => (
            <li className="pl4 blue flex-auto" key={i}>{item.name}</li>
        ))
    </ul>
)
```

---


### Abstract to Components

```javascript
const MenuContainer = ({ children }) =>
  <ul className="flex flex-row f3">{children}</ul>
const MenuItem = ({ children }) =>
  <li className="blue pl4 flex-auto">{children}</li>

const Menu = ({ items }) => (
  <MenuContainer>
    {items.map((item, i) => (
      <MenuItem key={i}>{item.name}</MenuItem>
    ))
  </MenuContainer>
)
```

---

## Benefits

* "Base" styles like font, type scale, space scale are all in one place and become consistent
* Many components will not need any additional stylesheet to be written at all
* Can be extended easily or combined with more traditional CSS approaches
* Minimal set up

---

## Drawbacks
* Still requires additional CSS styles for more advanced CSS selection techniques
* Learning curve involved with learning to read the terse class names and HTML
* Doesn't solve issues with global scope
* No way to ensure specificity of classes setting the same property

---

## Nanostyled

* A library that solves specificity issue of atomic CSS libraries
* Automatically creates props for your component to accept that make it customizable


---

```javascript
import nanostyled from 'nanostyled';
// This example uses CSS classes from Tachyons
import 'tachyons/css/tachyons.css';

// A Button via three style props:
const Button = nanostyled('button', {
  color: 'white',
  bg: 'bg-blue',
  base: 'fw7 br3 pa2 sans-serif f4 bn input-reset',
});

---

```javascript
const App = () => (
  <div>
    <Button>Base Button</Button>
    <Button bg="bg-yellow">Yellow Button</Button>
  </div>
);
```
