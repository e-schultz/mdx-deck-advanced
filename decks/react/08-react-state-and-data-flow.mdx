# React State & Data Flow

* Class Based Components 
* State
* Unidirectional Data Flow 
* LifeCycle

# Class Based Components 

* State
* LifeCycle 
* LifeCycle Hooks 

---

# React State 

* React Components Can Have Their Own Internal State
* Components Should Not Directly Mutate Their Own State
* Children Should Not Mutate Parent State

## Unidirectional Data Flow 

* Data Is Passed down via Props
* Callbacks, or Events Are Emitted to Tell the Parent Something Has Changed

---

```
+------------------------------------+
|                                    |
| Parent                             |
|            Props        Callback   |
|              |             ^       |
|              |             |       |
|              |             |       |
|              Ë‡             |       |
|            +-------------------+   |
|            |Child              |   |
|            |                   |   |
|            |                   |   |
|            +-------------------+   |
|                                    |
+------------------------------------+

### How Can App Know What the Count Is?

* Children Can Not Modify the Parent Component
* If App Was to Have It's Own Counter - How Would It Know?

```jsx
render() {
    return (
      <div className="App">
        <ul>
          <li>Hello World Count {this.state.helloWorldCount}</li>  
        </ul>
        { /* How can App know abpout changes in HelloWorld? */ }>
        <HelloWorld/> 
      </div>
    );
```
---

### How Can App Know What the Count Is?

* Remember - You Can Pass Functions as Props
* Pass a Callback That the Child
* Child Invokes It so the Parent Knows Something Has Changed 

---
export default FullScreenCode

### How Can App Know What the Count Is?

```jsx
handleCountChange(value) {
  this.setState({ helloWorldCount: value });
}
render() {
  return (
    <div className="App">
      <ul>
        <li>Hello World Count {this.state.helloWorldCount}</li>  
      </ul>
      <HelloWorld onCountChange={this.handleCountChange} /> 
    </div>
    );
}
```
---

### Why? 

* The Child Can Be Reused in Many Contexts
* The Child Can Be Reused in Many Times on One Screen
* Up to the Parent to Decide What to Do with the Change

---

### Why? 

* You Tell React When State Changes with `setState`
* React Does Not Automatically Observe or Dirty Check for You

---

```jsx  
/* ..... */
  render() {
    return (
      <div className="App">
      First Hello World Clicked: {this.state.helloWorldOne}<br/>
      Second Hello World Clicked: {this.state.helloWorldTwo}<br/>
      
      <HelloWorld onValueChange={this.handleClickOne} />
      <HelloWorld onValueChange={this.handleClickTwo} />
      </div>
    );
  }
```

### Data Down, Callbacks Up
