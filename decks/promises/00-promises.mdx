# Promises

---

## What We Will Cover

* What are they?
* Promises vs Callbacks 
* Chaining Promises
* Handling Errors
* Promise Patterns

---

## What Is a Promise?

* Represent an eventual result of an asynchronous operation 
* The result can be a successful completion, or a failure 

---

## What Is a Promise? 

> Essentially, a promise is a returned object to which you attach callbacks, instead of passing callbacks into a function.

[MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Using_promises)

---

## Constructing a Promise 

* Syntax: `new Promise(executor)`
* executor is a function that takes a resolve, and a reject. 

```javascript
let someValue = new Promise((resolve, reject)=> {
  resolve('Hello World')
});

someValue.then(result=>{
  console.log(result);
  return result;
})
```

---
export default Code

```javascript Using Promises
let someValue = new Promise((resolve, reject)=> {
  resolve('Hello World')
});

someValue.then(result=>{
  console.log(result);
  return result;
})
```

---
## Promises vs Callbacks

JavaScript is single threaded, so we can't really ever "wait" for a result of
a task such as an HTTP request. 

Our baseline solution is callbacks:

```javascript
  request(url, function(error, response) {
    // handle success or error.
  });
  doSomethingElse();
```

---

## Nesting becomes a problem

---


## Pyramid of Doom 

```javascript
  queryTheDatabase(query, function(error, result) {
    request(url, function(error, response) {
      doSomethingElse(response, function(error, result) {
        doAnotherThing(result, function(error, result) {
          request(anotherUrl, function(error, response) {
            ...
          })
        });
      })
    });
  });
```

---

## Could become 

```js
queryTheDataBase(query)
  .then((result)=>request(result.url))
  .then((result)=>doSomethingElse(result))
  .then((result)=>doAnotherThing(result))
  .then((result)=>request(anotherUrl))
```

# We have larger problems

- Hard to Decompose
- Specify Task and Callback at the Same Time 

```notes
The essence of the problem is that this pattern requires us to specify the
task and the callback at the same time. In contrast, promises allow us to
specify and dispatch the request in one place:</p>
```
