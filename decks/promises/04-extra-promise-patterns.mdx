### Sequential Promises

* When a Promise Does Not Rely on the Result of Another
* Want to Run Sequentially Instead of in Parallel
* Why? Maybe API rate limiting will complain if you fire off 500 at once.
* Good for bulk operations where you may not care about the actual api response

* Promise.all executes in Parallel 
* No built in Sequential --- so lets build it.
