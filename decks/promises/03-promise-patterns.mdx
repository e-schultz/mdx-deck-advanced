# Promise Patterns  
---

## Promise Patterns - Parallel

- Finish in any order
- Promises do not depend on the success of another 
- Only care once they all finish 

---

## Promise Patterns - Waterfall

- Order matters
- Another request needs the result of a previous 

---
## Promise Parallel - Promise.all

* Waits for all promises to resolve
* Gets passed into the handler as an array

```javascript
let promiseA = someRequest("A");
let promiseB = someRequest("B");
let PromiseC = someRequest("C");

Promise.all([promiseA, promiseB, promiseC]).then(results => {
  console.log("Hello Results", results);
});
```

---
## Promise.all - can also use destructuring

* Waits for all promises to resolve
* Gets passed into the handler as an array

```javascript
let promiseA = someRequest("A");
let promiseB = someRequest("B");
let PromiseC = someRequest("C");

Promise.all([promiseA, promiseB, promiseC]).then(
  ([resultA, resultB, resultC]) => {
    console.log(resultA, resultB, resultC);
  }
);
```

---
## API Consideration 

<a href="https://js-ts-training.now.sh/" target="_blank">Simple API</a>
---

## Exercise Time: 

* Get a game by ID
* Get a list of Platforms 
* Create a game object with the game name, and the platform name

```js
let expected = {
    id: 3,
    name: "Dragon Quest XI: Echoes of an Elusive Age",
    platformId: 1,
    platformName: "PS4"
  }

```

# Promise - waterfall 

* Same API as last time
* Maybe the Platform list is massive - and we want to get it by id
* Instead of returning all platforms
* Request a Game
* Request the Platform for that Game
* Display similar result.
